# ZSHRC

My customization for vanilla macos zsh.

* increased visibility prompt, showing time, path, git info (branch, dirty/clean status), and last command exitcode.
* working home/end keys
* enhanced tab completion (including for git)
* change directories without having to type 'cd'

## Item2

Iterm 2 supports the required powerline glyphs already, but its default color scheme is crappy: 

* Preferences > Profiles > Default > Text > enable "Use built-in Powerline glyphs
* Preferences > Profiles > Default > Colors > Color Presets > import and apply the supplied xterm.itermcolors file

## Terminal

Terminal requires you install and use a font with the required powerline glyphs patched in:
